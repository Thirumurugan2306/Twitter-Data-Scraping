# Twitter-Data-Scraping

This is a Twitter Scraper app built with Python using the Snscrape and Streamlit libraries. The app allows users to search for tweets by keyword or hashtag, and select a date range for the search. The app will then scrape the specified number of tweets and display them in a table. Users can download the data as a CSV or JSON file, and also store the data in a MongoDB database.

The app will display the scraped tweets in a table, and users can download the data as a CSV or JSON file, and also store the data in a MongoDB database.
